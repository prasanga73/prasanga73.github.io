Psychology always fascinated me. I take a great deal of pleasure in navigating the mindscape of people associated with the dark triad- narcissism, Machiavellianism and psychopathy. Informing myself with such knowledge is a relentless and pleasurable pursuit for me. It stirs my psyche with an unexplainable amount of thrill and insanity. Deconstructing the behavioural pattern and bridging the gap between thoughts and actions makes me feel omniscient for a fleeting moment. Maybe it’s the dopamine shooting beyond its limits. But, who cares? 

So, let’s take a brief walk into the world of dark triad now, shall we? Narcissist (Narcissism) , a term often used as an insult to infuriate someone simply means for a person with an excessive preoccupation with oneself and one’s own needs. Like the infamous Tom Riddle(Voldemort) from our beloved childhood nostalgia, Harry Potter. A narcissist, in plain observation from a distance, seems to have very fanciful obsessions with his own regards.

Now, the next one we have in order is Machiavellianism. The term comes from Niccolò Machiavelli, who described the personality trait in his 16th century book “The Prince”. Machiavellianism is a personality trait that denotes cunningness, the ability to be manipulative, and a drive to use whatever means necessary to gain power. It mandates the use of anything and everything in reach to secure the task at hand. Cersei Lannister from the web series, Game of Thrones is a prime example as such. The Machiavellians are strategists, the chess players of life. They are driven by long term gains rather than short lived bursts of pleasure-seeking actions. 

Finally, comes the cold and ruthless, psychopathy. The trait which regards no empathy but exudes extreme charm and allure driven by thrill seeking impulsive tendencies. Psychopaths, they are incapable of registering emotional gravity of any situation. They have a natural inclination to seek thrill and stimulation. So, it is easier for them to exercise extreme behaviours in the process. If you have watched Vampire Diaries, then vampires turning off the humanity switch is the best example of psychopathy. 

For me, this fascination for psychology stems from an urge to explore into the mysterious realm of human subconscious. Partly to understand the primal aspect  of my psyche too. Among the dark triad, the trait that taps deep into my curiosity is psychopathy. Dive deep into your inner being and ask yourself- what is it about emotional detachment and lack of empathy that captures your imaginative mind? And, have you ever wondered how would it feel to be unfazed by emotions? Even from those springing from our primal instincts.  How would that experience of blunted internal response be like? It adds an element of uncertainty, an air of mystery to it. Psychopathy, to me feels like a restricted or a secluded region where even light feigns ignorance. And, all that is denied is all what a human seeks. I so happened to be a human too, ahahaha.

The horizon has begun to charcoal and the clock shows almost 6 pm. I have no energy to write further. So, I would like to mark this abrupt ending as a style of writing where the writer urges the readers’ imagination to take control.
