I had this little hope for the longest time. A small glimmer of faith. That little thing in me, it often whispered to me in a hushed tone. Whispers of reconciliation when I spiraled down too deep. Whispers of better days when moments felt bleak and eerie. Those whispers gave me warmth. Like the embrace of sun rays in cold grips of winter. They pulled scattered fragments of me back together in one piece- making me believe that it would turn pretty again. 

The whispers, they were not all rainbows and unicorns either. A double edged sword in the finest comparison, for it also made me cling onto things. Things I should have discarded. Things I should've left on my way long ago. But, how could have I left nuisances that made my heart satiated? 

Leaving them astray meant that I would have been free. Free, yet with the cost of burden that I flinched away from love without even trying. It was a dilemma I could never decipher.  

Always thought that we would someday revisit the dreams we decorated together. Paint them with fresh colours. Give them a life they'd never dare regret. But, the colours, they splattered to the ground with a mild thud. Scattered everywhere, tracing paths to nowhere. A resurfacing void still screams in despair when the world around me is imprisoned in a glair white silence.

[_Oh, I used to say!;)_]
