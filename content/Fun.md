What would be your definition of a party? Ease your mind into the idea of having fun for you. Contemplate for a brief moment about it. Okay, that’s enough. Come back to reality now. For some people, the notion of having fun may be loud music and rather electrifying dance in a gathering of friends and family while a fraction of others might prefer drinking and deloading. Some of us are also thrilled with the concept of camping under the starry sky. But then, among the myriad of choices, there is an another class of people who like the mundane, with a very ordinary idea of having fun. [_Well, I have slipped into being one of them, happily sadly ._]

For us, picking up a novel and lying there in bed -- twisting and turning, flipping through the pages and uncovering the plot seems fanciful. Slipping into an imagination where we could draw our rivers and bring our thunders to calm is another fun activity, though it may draw a fine line between being imaginative and being insane. Not being a narcissist but let’s talk about me. A party to me, specifically would be something as simple as drinking a mild liquor with my partner. And stemming from the warmth of it, indulge myself into a slow dance to an unbroken breath of ambient music. I also enjoy the comforting shade of a tree in a grassy meadow when the sun in scorching hot and the breeze is playfully cool. Letting the words scatter onto a blank page, where not the hand but the heart shapes them, is oddly therapeutic. But, sadly social interaction with more than 5 people pierces a cut in my body and my energy seems to drain from that incision. Thus, socializing in excess is just a depleting thing for me.

So, the party is quiet and the fun is discreet. Yet, the enjoyment is just as much as it ought to be. Just fascinating how happiness meets us in our own ways, through the different lenses we use to see life.
