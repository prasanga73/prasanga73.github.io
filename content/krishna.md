Krishna, meaning “dark” or “dark blue” in Sanskrit, can also be interpreted as “all-attractive” or “charming”.  He had a dark complexion and a transcendental physical appearance, hence the name. This is the less vivid and not so colourful depiction of Krishna, kind of like a bookish definition. So, who is Krishna or what is Krishna, if you may ask? But before that, let’s paint a picture of Krishna in the blank canvas of our mind.

Krishna, a son to a cowherd family in Gokul was raised by Nanda and Yashoda. He is known for his divine miracles, playfulness and compassionate nature. He had an uncle Kansa, who feared due to a prophecy that Krishna would be the cause for his death. So, Kansa had a fair share of demons whom he put in line to kill Krishna. But, he and his demons failed every single time and bowed down to the supreme nature of Krishna. Bhagvad Gita, an undoubtedly pristine book was also Krishna’s giving to the humankind for establishing dharma(righteousness not religion). 

Now that we have a little idea of what Krishna was like, we can now delve into understanding him in a more profound way. Krishna was more than a human who once walked on the same Earth we now tread. He is the beginning, the middle and the end of all pervading universe. 

Krishna is, and in all that is divine; the nectar of perfection, the hymn of the creation. Not only the divine, the essence of him lies even in the very ordinary or even the vilest of things. But, how can a God or a supreme consciousness lie in blasphemous things too? It is a question that every seeker asks and most believers dismiss. As you venture into understanding the intricacies of a being situated beyond our perception and reality, the concept of duality needs to rest.

In the silence of mind, the compassion of heart, the stillness of breath and the unity of thoughts—the distinction of duality merges to one that is Krishna.
