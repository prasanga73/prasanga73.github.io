I don’t usually verbalize or jot down my thoughts about such questions. They always remain suspended in the quiet corners of my mind. In the empty spaces between my degenerate thoughts. But, today, I happened to recollect some hazy details of my  very dystopian dream. It made me wonder and contemplate about the questions everyone asked but eventually forgot. One of the forgotten one, simple and plain in sight yet sinks deep into the abyss of our soul. “Why are we here?”

Are we here to serve a higher purpose? Is it all God’s play for the endless fascination of divinity? Or maybe these questions are what we asked ourselves to stop questioning? Giving the authority to a higher figure definitely eases our existential dread. But, it also makes us a believer, bound to believe whatever is shed upon us. And, we stray from being a seeker, whose life was immersed in the air of truth. 
But, what if our limited senses are the ones constricting our ability to converse to things beyond our limitations? What if our truth drawn by our experiences are not the absolute truth at all? It makes us a believer too if we close ourselves to the boundless possibilities we can entertain.

While I may not fully grasp the concept of a higher figure, I also do not object it. If serving someone higher brings us love and tranquility, then being a believer isn’t so bad. If we strip ourselves of all the experiences we have had, all the ideas we embraced, and unlearn every tendencies we gathered, love is the only thing that makes sense. So, “ Why are we here?” meets with [_“ To let love flow in our veins”_] in the quiet corners of my mind.
