I just want your heart filled with warmth,<br>
when your vicinity is my deep fragrance,<br>
Let your careless gestures show comfort,<br>
for your presence heals my silent wounds. <br>


I just want your eyes to soften,<br>
when your gaze rests upon me,<br>
Let your eyes pierce the silence,<br>
for your lips might never speak.<br>


My eyes shall follow too,<br>
with muffled whispers,<br>
Unspoken in words,<br>
but,<br>
described in quiet glances,<br>
with a gentle promise:<br>
[_"For you, a thousand times over."_]
