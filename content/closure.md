I just want your heart filled with warmth,
when your vicinity is my deep fragrance,
Let your careless gestures show comfort,
for your presence heals my silent wounds. 

I just want your eyes to soften,
when your gaze rests upon me,
Let your eyes pierce the silence,
for your lips might never speak. 

My eyes shall follow too,
with muffled whispers,
Unspoken in words,
but,
described in quiet glances,
with a gentle promise:
[_"For you, a thousand times over."_]
